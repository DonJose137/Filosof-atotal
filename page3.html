        <h2>Ancient times</h2>
        <h3>Presocratics</h3>
            <p1>They were the first to initiate the call of "passing from myths to logos". They were interested in the origin, structure and laws of the universe; the search for an ultimate principle (arj√©) that would explain the physical changes of nature.</p1></div>  
        <h3>Sophist</h3>
            <p1>These concerned themselves with anthropological problems linked to man and his behavior in moral and political affairs. Their job in society was to impart their knowledge and teach wisdom by charging for what they had to put rhetoric into practice. In the same way, these were relativists and skeptics, that is, there was no absolute truth, so it is not possible to achieve objective knowledge.</p1>
        <h3>Clasics</h3>
            <p1>These were based on the study of the nature of man and his behavior in society. Within this group are Socrates, Plato and Aristotle.</p1>
        <h3>Hellenistics</h3>
            <p1>After the death of Alexander the Great in Rome, a crisis of cops and a cultural expansion arose, which triggered a crisis of a social model that motivated the search for happiness.</p1>
