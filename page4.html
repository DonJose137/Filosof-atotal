        <h2>Medieval times</h2>
        <h3>Patristics</h3>
            <p1>Conformed by the fathers of the Church, it was a doctrine that sought the synthesis between philosophy and religion, that is, it emphasized the fight of faith and reason. They have a platonic influence separating the body from the soul since the first was something finite while the soul was something immortal capable of communicating with God.</p1></div>  
        <h3>Scholastics</h3>
            <p1>Compared to patristics, this school sought to find harmony between faith and reason by understanding divine revelation using human reason. They had an Aristotelian influence, that is to say, they tried to give answers to questions previously formulated in a logical way from learning by experience.</p1>
