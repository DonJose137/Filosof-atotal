        <h2>Modern Era</h2>
        <h3>Rationalism</h3>
            <p1>Rationalism maintains that the source of knowledge is reason and rejects the idea of ​​the senses, since they can deceive us; defends the exact sciences, specifically mathematics.</p1></div>  
        <h3>Empiricism</h3>
            <p1>This doctrine, compared to rationalism, postulated that the only source of knowledge is reflective and internal experience, so there are no innate ideas.</p1>
        <h3>Idealism</h3>
            <p1>Its main representative was Immanuel Kant, although at first it was used to refer to Plato's philosophy since he affirmed that the true reality was constituted by the world of ideas and not by material things. Kant used another meaning to refer to the transcendental idealism which affirmed that knowledge is born from the union of sensitivity and understanding since single forms and intuitions do not produce knowledge.</p1>
